/**
  * Priority for completions.
  * 
  * 
  *
  * To ensure that completions are displayed "most useful" first, we precede sortText with a number. Priorities
  * differ depending on the type of completion, and can be boosted depending upon context (e.g. type completions
  * are boosted if the cursor is preceded by a ":")
  *
  * 1: High: completions which are only available within a very specific context
  * 2: Boost: completions which are normally low priority, but the context makes them more likely
  * 4: Snippet: snippets are relatively high priority because they're rare, and to be useful at all they need to be available
  * 5: Local: local variables
  * 7: Normal: completions that are relevant within no particular context
  * 9: Low: completions that are unlikely to be relevant unless within a specific context
